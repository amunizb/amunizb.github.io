		<p>My research focuses on Lagrangian cobordisms and their relation to Chow groups. More precisely, recently I've been thinking about:
			<ul>
				<li>Computations: I've computed the Lagrangian cobordism group of a symplectic bielliptic surface. This is (to my knowledge) the first computation of a cobordism group in dimension greater than two.</li>
				<li>Dimensionality: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03892" class ="link" target="_blank">Sheridan-Smith</a> showed that cobordism groups of symplectic 4-manifolds are often huge. I extended this result to arbitrary dimensions, just as Roitman.</li>
				<li>Higher cobordism groups and higher K-theory: the ordinary Lagrangian cobordism group is related to the Grothendieck group of the Fukaya category. I am working on the construction of higher analogues of the cobordism group that detect the higher K-theory of the Fukaya category. (These groups should be mirror to higher Chow groups, as defined by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001870886900812?via%3Dihub" class="link" target="blank">Bloch</a>)</li>

						<p>The Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of classical (Hamiltonian) mechanics turns the problem of solving n PDEs of second order to 2n first order PDEs. In this paper, we extend this formalism to contact Hamiltonian systems (roughly speaking, contact dynamics deals with mechanical systems in which the energy is dissipated). </p>
